# Usage

This chapter guides you on how to use the `Subscan` to efficiently discover subdomains. Subdomain discovery features are implemented as modular `SubscanModule` components, which are automatically executed when a scan is initiated. For technical insights, check out the [Development](/development/index.html) chapter
